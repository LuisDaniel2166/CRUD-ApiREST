# CRUD-ApiREST
 The main idea of this project is to be able to view, store, modify and delete notes that the user wishes to write in order to maintain a better order in their daily life.

 Backend description
 For the development of the WebServer (REST API) different technologies are used, such as:
    -Node.js
    -Express
    -MongoDB
    -Mongoose
 Being used to receive and execute the different requests generated by users.
 In this part, the different models necessary for the development of this project were created in addition to the routes to be able to access the different requests that are generated by the user, other than the basic configuration so that the webserver can work for now at least locally (The database will be mounted on the MongoDB Atlas cloud service).
